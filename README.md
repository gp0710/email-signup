## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
Oof. Just when I thought that I knew much about what I needed to know about HTML/CSS, I keep coming across something new to learn. This challenge took me 3-4 days. If I could start over from scratch, I wouldn't be too concerned about margin. With flexbox and grid, I can easily position elements on a page relative to each other without worrying about having to manually adjust the alignment for each. That could have easily saved me a day of effort, and I'd have a responsive site for tablets or screens that have a min-width of 1000px. 

Unfortunately the site isn't too responsive for screens 376px < x < 1440px. I won't be fixing this for now, I'm going to let the new concepts I applied get ingrained in my mind first.

- display: grid; 
- SVG elements
- background-image: url('')
- rem 


### Continued development

Will be considering making the site more responsive for screens 376px < x 1439px
